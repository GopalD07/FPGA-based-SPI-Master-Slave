A Verilog implementation of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Master controller designed and verified on FPGA using Intel Quartus II and ModelSim simulation.

## üìã Abstract

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a commonly accepted 4-wire standard configuration for synchronous serial communication used primarily for short-distance wired communication between a microcontroller and peripheral ICs. This project focuses on the implementation of an SPI Master using the simplest configuration of SPI which is a single master, single slave system, on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

The communication protocol establishes a master-slave relationship where the master is the controlling device, and the slave (sensor, display, or memory chip) takes instruction from the master. SPI uses four wires for communication: **MOSI**, **MISO**, **SCLK**, and **SS/CS**.

**Keywords:** SPI Master, MISO, MOSI, Slave select, Full-duplex serial, FPGA

## üéØ Project Overview

This academic project demonstrates the implementation of SPI Master functionality with the following characteristics:

- **Configuration**: Single Master, Single Slave
- **Data Width**: 8-bit parallel input/output
- **Communication**: Full-duplex synchronous serial
- **Platform**: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
- **Tools**: Intel Quartus II, ModelSim-Altera

## üìö Literature Survey

SPI is a full-duplex synchronous serial communication protocol, allowing data to be simultaneously transmitted in both directions. Originally developed by **Motorola in the mid-1980s** for inter-chip communication.

### Key Research Findings:

- **Evolution**: SPI has evolved from single integrated circuit communication to support various microcontrollers, sensors, displays, and memory devices
- **Applications**: Widely used in flash memory, sensors, real-time clocks, analog-to-digital converters, SD card readers, RFID modules, and 2.4 GHz wireless transceivers
- **Protocol Modes**: Four SPI modes (0, 1, 2, 3) with different clock polarity and phase configurations
- **Performance Research**: Various clocking schemes explored to enhance data rates, minimize latency, and reduce power consumption
- **Verification**: Functional verification achievable through simulation using EDA tools

### SPI Signal Lines:

| Signal | Full Name | Direction | Description |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **MOSI** | Master Output/Slave Input | Master ‚Üí Slave | Data transmission line |
| **MISO** | Master Input/Slave Output | Slave ‚Üí Master | Data reception line |
| **SCLK** | Serial Clock | Master ‚Üí Slave | Clock signal for synchronization |
| **SS/CS** | Slave Select/Chip Select | Master ‚Üí Slave | Slave selection (active low) |

## üèóÔ∏è Module Architecture

### Port Configuration

```verilog
module SPI_master (
    input sclk,                    // Serial clock from master
    input [7:0] data_in,          // Data to be transmitted from master
    output reg [7:0] data_out,    // Output for data received from slave
    input miso,                   // Master In Slave Out
    output reg ss,                // Slave select (active low)
    input ss_initiate,            // Transmission initiation signal
    output reg mosi               // Master Out Slave In
);
```

### Internal Registers
- **Counter `i`**: Tracks MOSI bit transmission (0-7)
- **Counter `j`**: Tracks MISO bit reception (0-7)
- **State Control**: Manages transmission phases

## ‚ö° Methodology & Algorithm

### Operational Flow Algorithm:

1. **Initialize** i and j registers to 0
2. **Initialize** ss signal to 1 (deselect slave)
3. **On rising edge** of sclk, check conditions:
   - `ss_initiate == 1`
   - `i < 8` 
   - `j < 8`
4. **If conditions met:**
   - Select slave: `ss = 0`
   - Shift data: `mosi = data_in[i]`
   - Capture data: `data_out[j] = miso`
   - Increment counters: `i++, j++`
5. **If conditions not met:**
   - Deselect slave: `ss = 1`
   - Set high impedance: `mosi = Z, data_out = Z`
6. **Repeat** until transmission complete (8 bits)

## üß™ Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing Approach

This project was verified using **ModelSim manual input methodology** rather than automated testbenches, providing hands-on control over signal timing and behavior observation.

### ModelSim Testing Procedure:

**1. Signal Monitoring Setup:**
```tcl
# Add all signals to waveform window
add wave -noupdate /SPI_master/sclk
add wave -noupdate /SPI_master/ss_initiate
add wave -noupdate /SPI_master/ss
add wave -noupdate -radix hexadecimal /SPI_master/data_in
add wave -noupdate -radix hexadecimal /SPI_master/data_out
add wave -noupdate /SPI_master/mosi
add wave -noupdate /SPI_master/miso
add wave -noupdate -radix unsigned /SPI_master/i
add wave -noupdate -radix unsigned /SPI_master/j
```

**2. Manual Input Test Sequences:**

**Basic Transmission Test:**
```tcl
# Generate clock signal
force sclk 0 0ns, 1 10ns -repeat 20ns

# Set test data
force data_in 8'hAA 0ns
force miso 0 0ns
force ss_initiate 0 0ns

# Initiate transmission
force ss_initiate 1 40ns
run 200ns

# Observe results in waveform
```

**Slave Response Test:**
```tcl
# Simulate slave data transmission
force miso 1 50ns, 0 70ns, 1 90ns, 0 110ns, 1 130ns, 0 150ns, 1 170ns, 0 190ns
force ss_initiate 1 40ns
run 300ns

# Verify full-duplex operation
examine data_out
```
